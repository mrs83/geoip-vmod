Usage:

./configure VARNISHSRC=DIR

VARNISHSRC is the directory of the Varnish source tree for which to
compile your vmod. Both the VARNISHSRC and VARNISHSRC/include
will be added to the include search paths for your module.

Make targets:
    make - builds the vmod
    make install - installs your vmod in VMODDIR
    make check - runs the unit tests in src/tests/*.vtc

In your VCL you could then use this vmod like the following. This
sets the request header X-GeoIP to the requestor's country code.
    ,----
    | import geoip;
    |
    | sub vcl_recv {
    |     set req.http.X-Forwarded-For = client.ip;
    |     set req.http.X-GeoIP = geoip.country(req.http.X-Forwarded-For)
    | }
    `----

Instead, you can set the header with a JSON-like hash including all the
data (city, latitude, longitude).
    ,----
    | import geoip;
    |
    | sub vcl_recv {
    |     set req.http.X-Forwarded-For = client.ip;
    |     set req.http.X-GeoIP = geoip.record(req.http.X-Forwarded-For)
    | }
    `----
